# Abstract
   Our project manages booking the library books and event registration in an Android
Application (app) and website. This is done by providing an interface to user to book the
library books through app and website, and to host and participate in events conducted by
college in a more easy way.
In the front end we have used android UI and java, at the back end we have used firebase
server. The project proceeds through a sequence of well-designed forms provided to ensure
consistency, reliability and most importantly making work unambiguous.

# Introduction
   The app is designed for booking library books and event registration. In booking library
books the student is requested to give the authors name and book as input. This information is
given to librarian via firebase server to the website designed for librarian.
In event registration the student can register for the list events conducted by college by just
one click. The student can see the description, date, fee through the app and can register
himself. If there is any important notice to be sent to the student, it will be sent as
notification. The student himself can host the events by becoming an admin and enter the
details. The admin will get following details such as number of students registered, students
profile.

# Objectives:
• Booking library books from anywhere.
• Event registration helps the students to register easily to any event.
